# Theory
The algorithm uses video only (no audio). It is likely to perform poorly on single-colored backgrounds with text - so try to avoid these in your assets.
## Terminology
Some basic concepts/"big words" will be used as terminology in this project:
 - ***asset***: A video that you own. Your motivation for using this project is that you wish to find your *asset* within other videos (*compilations*)
 - ***compilation***: A video often containing several different clips, where one of these might be yours. In practice, this can be any video you want to check if your asset is inside of.
